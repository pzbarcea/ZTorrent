# TODO

* Refactor packaging from `Main` to `edu.umd.cs.ztorrent`
* Read the homework appropriately.
* Release before submitting to teacher with `2022.0.1`
* Generate class diagram before submitting, also helps with documentation of the project:
![class diagram](/docs/images/class-diagram.png "Class diagram")
* Clean commented code.
* Refactor `Logic` package to something else, as doesn't mean anything.
* Refactor all 6 main classes and decide which ones are useful (to keep) and which ones to destroy.
```csh
ztorrent on ÓÇ† main [‚úò!] is üì¶ v1.0-SNAPSHOT via ‚òï v1.8.0

./src/main/java/Main/LionShare.java
./src/main/java/Main/SeedTest.java
./src/main/java/Main/UnitTests.java
./src/main/java/Primitives/Piece.java
./src/main/java/TorrentData/MagnetLink.java
./src/main/java/Trackers/DHTTracker.java
```
* Refactor `NetBase` package to something else
* Refactor `Primitives` to something else
* Refactor `TorrentData` to something else
* Maybe Refactor `Trackers` to something else.
* Refactor `Utils` to something else.
* Fix exception. This is maybe normal behavior when a peer-to-peer connection can't be established due to security limitations:
```
java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)
```
